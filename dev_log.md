# Development Log (Date: 10/30/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
    -Complete Team Contract Document
    -Figue out project specfics including algorithms and their uses
    -Complete Project Proposal/Description Document
    -Create GitHub Repo.
    -Get in contact with mentor
    
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
    -Team contract written by Jason Segal. Signed & approved by everyone.
    -Project Proposal developed and written by all group members.
    -GitHub repository was created and shared with all team members and project mentor.
    -Held a team meeting with everyone via Zoom on 10/31/22 to discuss project specfics and get on same page about the project. A second meeting was held on 11/2/22 to further specify the algorithms to be included and the project proposal was formally written out there.
    -Devlopment log for the week logged by Jason Segal.
    
## Problems Encountered 
    -Dubious on the topic and algorithms to choose 
    -Wasn't 100% sure on Big-O runtime for the A-star algorithm
    

## Plans for next week
    -Work on data parsing pipeline
## Optional: Questions for mentor
    -A* Big O Runtime clarification (emailed)
    -What is your favorite food?

# Development Log (Date: 11/4/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals
    -Make data parsing pipeline
    -Create makefile
    -Develop data strucutre code framework
    
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
    -The Development log was written by Jason Segal
    -Scheduled task (entire team)
    -Started work on data parsing component Jason Segal
    -Other than that, it has been a busy week for all of us, so not much else this week. We are planning on getting more things completed over the weekend.
## Problems Encountered 
    -Not much, just some minor coordination issues of trying to find a time to meet as everyone's schedule's are busy.
## Plans for next week
    -We are scheduling a meeting to figure out the new algorithm and get some of the details worked out for the data strucutures as well as assigning tasks.
    -Finish up making the data parsing portion
    -Schedule time to meet with our Mentor for the mid-project check-in
    -Begin work on the BFS algorithm and create test cases for it
    
## Optional: Questions for mentor
    -How and when are we supposed to schedule the mid-project check-in meeting?
    -We emailed this question to you already: Did we need to pick another algorithm since Dijkstra's and A* are too similar and if so what are some suggestions you recommend.
# Development Log (Date: 11/12/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals
-Fix Project proposal
-Finish Data Parsing portion
-Finish CalculateWeightsfunction
-Make makefile
-Starts BFS algorithm/function


## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
-Data parsing portion implmented by Jason Segal
-Main header file and class structure developed by Aadit Roy Chowdhury and Jason Segal
-Created cpp file for main class and implemented calculate weight function (by Benson Bai)
-Held meeting to fix proposal, assign tasks, and ensure everyone was on the same page. This was conducted by everyone.

## Problems Encountered 
-Time delays with people busy
