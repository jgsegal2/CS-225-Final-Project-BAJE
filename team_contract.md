# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

Ninety minutes once a week based on whenever people are free during a week. At the moment we will do one day during the week or a Sunday check-in. We will be hosting in-person meetings and Zoom if necessary to fit the schedule of teammates. Each week someone will be designated the official project notetaker and be tasked with summarizing what was discussed at the meeting and creating a draft for the development log for the week which should be looked over and amended by the rest of the group members by the end of the week to be turned in. Team meetings can also be held asynchronously through our DIscord group chat.

2. **Assistance** 

Teammates will be able to contact one another on a Discord group chat created. Teammates should respond within 24 hours if need be.

3. **Respect** 

Discord group is open to everyone and members can post their ideas without limits. We can also share thoughts freely during meetings. All teammates should be active listeners snd engage with and respect the ideas and beliefs of their fellow teammates. Teammates should create an open and safe environment that is welcoming and conducive to all ideas for the project.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

Work should be split as equally as possible between members. Team members will likely each take an algorithm and/or part of the interface depending on the workload of each component. Debugging issues should be directed toward Jason Segal but should be seen in a collaborative manner that all team members can help with. At some point, members may have to pick up slack from their other teammates and it is expected that the other teammates recipercrates or picks up some other work by the person who did their expected work later on. 

5. **Time Commitment** 

It is expected that group members spend about 2-3 hours a week working on some aspect of the project. This can be conceptual, implementation, organizational, or some other aspect. It is understandable that everyone has other commitments and at times won’t be able to meet this expectation. These prior time commitments will be taken into account with a degree of understanding for them. As long as the project is still relatively on track, the teammate assures the completion of the delayed component at a certain date, and the teammate openly communicates about conflicts and commitments that arise, there will be no penalty. Otherwise if some sort of violation occurs, the remaining members of the group will meet to decide further action.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

To work to resolve disagreements, a forum will be called to have a dialogue about the issue. Dialogue and open conversation are the most important elements in which conflicts can be readily and easily solved. If the issue relates to a specific person and isn’t readily resolved, a three-strike system may be implemented for the offender where the other groupmates will decide what counts as a strike. If three strikes occur then the other groupmates will take a vote to escalate the issue to a report to course staff.
