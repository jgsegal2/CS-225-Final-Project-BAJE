-Output and correctness of each algorithm:

There are two readinfile() functions, one that takes in no parameters and does the data parsing of the airports and routes for the data from OpenFlights automatically. The second readinfile() takes in two file names, the first for the airports file name and the second for the route file name and can be used to input custom airports and routes. Both functions have no output but do create the graph or airports and routes used in subsequent algorithms. Tests for the data parsing test the number of verticies in the graph, the kind of verticies in the graph, and the proper edges exist.

-Answer to your leading question:

Our leading question being to find the shortest path in terms of distance between two airports US along with finding airports at a similar distance to offer the user comparative options to go to.
