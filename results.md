-Output and correctness of each algorithm: <i>  You should summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests you performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.</i>

There are two readinfile() functions, one that takes in no parameters and does the data parsing of the airports and routes for the data from OpenFlights automatically. The second readinfile() takes in two file names, the first for the airports file name and the second for the route file name and can be used to input custom airports and routes. Both functions have no output but do create the graph or airports and routes used in subsequent algorithms. Tests for the data parsing test the number of verticies in the graph, the kind of verticies in the graph, and the proper edges exist.

Our implementation of Floyd Warshall takes in four parameters. When used on a graph, the function will only consider vertices with a minimum number of edges each, a value determined by edge_bound, one of the function parameters. All shortest path pairs between all vertices will be calculated characteristic to Floyd Warshall, but the origin parameter will determine which starting airports to filter out. The num_back parameter will return the closest num_back amount of destinations below the distance parameter and the closest num_back amount of destinations above the distance parameter. If we run the function with ("ORD", 1290.65, 0, 1), on the six vertex test map, with ORD being Chicago. Then the first return value will be a destination closer than 1290.65 km, and the second return value will be further than 1290.65. The former, Washington DC, is closer than all other aiports below 1290.65 km. The latter, NYC, is closer than all other aiports above 1290.65 km.


-Answer to your leading question: <i> You should direct address your proposed leading question. How did you answer this question? What did you discover? If your project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what you would do differently as a team. </i>

Our leading question being to find the shortest path in terms of distance between two airports US along with finding airports at a similar distance to offer the user comparative options to go to.
